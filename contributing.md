# Contribution Guidelines
Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:
- Search included talks before adding a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Use the following format: `[Name](link) (Year) - Description.`
- If you can't find the year the talk was made in, you can skip adding the year.
- `Name` should include the author who made the talk. Add it to the end after `-`.
- The talk should be put into its appropriate category. Pick the one you think is closest if you are not sure.
- Only add talks you think are awesome.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorisation are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- You can also add related links and repositories in the end.
